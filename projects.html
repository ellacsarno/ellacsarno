                            <p>As the online event producer I successfully managed the access of <b>over 500 participants and speakers</b> to Georgetown’s Zoom Events platform.

                            <p>As the in-person event producer, I coordinated <b>a team of over 20 student volunteers</b> to cover sessions, take photos, and manage front desk duties.

Our rebranding campaign, complete with billboard ads, innovative eco-friendly merch, light installations, print publications, and digital products, was praised by Kreativ, Hungary’s leading advertising and marketing industry publication. The 2022 edition of Budapest Ritmo also saw record ticket sales, sold out each night of the 3-day festival.</p>

                        <h1>Ad content management system</h1> <p>As a junior marketing specialist at Dreamjo.bs, I manually managed the company's social media advertising campaigns, sometimes over 60 ads at a time. This prompted me to develop my own automated posting system. Our strategy was to micro-target software developers with highly specific skillsets to deliver applicants to our job postings. Working as part of a small team and without a content management system, I developed a spreadsheet that helped us automate part of the work, allowing us to save time and scale up faster.</p>
