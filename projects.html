                        <h1>RSD 12 Event Production Manager</h1> <p>I was the event production manager of the RSD 12 Washington, D.C. in-person conference, as well as the 15-day RSD 12 ONLINE event, streaming from 12 global locations. I worked closely with RSD 12’s chief organizer, Cheryl May, and the Georgetown RSD 12 team led by Dr. Evan Barba.</p>

                            <p>As the online event producer I successfully managed the access of over 500 participants and speakers total to Georgetown’s Zoom Events platform. I also made sure each session started on time, was recorded, and that technical help and troubleshooting with presentations was available to speakers.</p>
                            
                            <p>As the in-person event producer, I coordinated a team of over 20 student volunteers to cover sessions, take photos, and manage front desk duties. I helped design and set-up the live stream from Georgetown’s on-site conference, and managed the live stream myself for the time of the event.</p>

                        <h1>Culture Collective</h1> <p>Facilitated the launching process of a new student project at Georgetown’s Communication, Culture, & Technology department. I provided guidance on outreach, event organization, and production, and helped develop the core concepts that the club was built around. The Culture Collective was conceived of and designed by Paola García Acuña, and debuted with great success with guest speaker Axel Arth from the Milken Center for Advancing the American Dream.</p>

CBA empowers students to share their marketable skills with each other, fostering invaluable skills like public speaking, leadership, and peer-to-peer education.

                        <h1>Balkan World Music Guide</h1> <p>The Balkan World Music Guide is a catalogue of the best that the Balkan has to offer in world and folk music. I pitched the concept, wrote and edited the content, and worked closely with the graphic designer, Nur Mohammed, to come up with the publication’s visual identity. I also coordinated the printing and distribution process of 5000 copies, shipping to 12 European countries in 2022. The Balkan World Music Guide has since become a staple publication for the MOST Music project and got republished every project year.</p>

I coordinated a team of 6 young photographers over 4 festival days, covering events from dusk to dawn. I also closely supported Zsuzsa Kover, head of communication in 2022, with each aspect of the festival’s communication strategy.</p>

                        <h1>Budapest Ritmo Rebranding</h1> <p>Budapest Ritmo is a city festival that needed rebranding after 5 years. I was a key figure in the rebranding effort, working under Sara Venczel, head of communication at Hangveto. I managed the redesign, deployment, and testing of the festival’s new website. I also rewrote the website copy in English and Hungarian. I also participated in every step of the visual rebranding process, working closely with designer Nur Mohammed. Our rebranding campaign, complete with billboard ads, innovative eco-friendly merch, light installations, print publications, and digital products, was praised by Kreativ, Hungary’s leading advertising and marketing industry publication. The 2022 edition of Budapest Ritmo also saw record ticket sales, sold out each night of the 3-day festival.</p>

                        <h1>Ad content management system</h1> <p>As a junior marketing specialist at Dreamjo.bs, I manually managed over 60 social media advertising campaigns, which prompted me to develop my own automated posting system. The company’s strategy was to micro-target software developers with highly specific skillsets to deliver applicants to our job postings. Much of the responsibility of delivering on this relied on marketing. Working as part of a small team and without a content management system, I developed a spreadsheet that helped us automate part of the work, allowing us to save time and scale up faster.</p>
