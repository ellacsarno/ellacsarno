<p>Ella and her co-authors published her MA thesis research, <strong><a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-06050-2_9">In Social Media We Distrust: Investigating Users’ Hostile Media Perception of Facebook News Content</a></strong>.</p>

<p>She has over a decade of experience in strategic communication, with a focus on event production and outreach. She led the communication of international projects at <a href="https://hangveto.hu/en/">Hangvető</a>, specifically <a href="https://mostmusic.eu/">MOST</a> – the Bridge for Balkan Music and <a href="https://upbeat-platform.eu/">UPBEAT</a> – the European Showcase Platform for World Music.
